A repo for everything I do in l4d2, whether complete or incomplete.

Source will always be the most recent version, but no promises about compiled binaries.

Fair warning, if you randomly stumbled onto this repo, most of the stuff on here is outdated due to having dropped the game for 6 or 7 years, and much of it would need some work to work again, work I'm unlikely to put in at this time.
At the same time, the config-specific plugins like l4d2arena were never even finished and likely never will be!
