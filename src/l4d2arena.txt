Some notes for when I have time for this again:
- Split the plugin up into modules.
- Give it its own github repo.
- Allow game mode to be changed the same way configs can be changed in confogl/lgofnoc.
- Maybe just work on surv-surv modes at first. And then only add in 1 SI class at a time.
- Work on no-class surv-surv 1v1 before other game modes. Ã€ la quake duel.
- Add an invisibility powerup!
- Try manually rotating powerups on a short timer. Or try it ongameframe
